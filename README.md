# 🎓 PSC Learning Journey

This learning experience is about discovering how to secure Linux in a corporate setting focusing on:&#x20;

* Best practices
* Industry standards
* Adhering to regulations

Throughout this experience, we'll explore the concepts of "**Controls:** _their implementation, and how they fit into overall security posture_."

We'll practice to securely build, deploy, integrate, and monitor Linux systems. Standard security documentation & reporting is also emphasized.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**What Makes This Different**

We use the same compliance frameworks, security tools, and hardening procedures used in government and enterprise environments.&#x20;



Every session builds hands-on skills that translate directly to professional security engineering roles.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this jurney, we will be able to:

{% hint style="success" %}
1. **🏗️ Build and configure** a Linux system to adhere to compliance frameworks
2. **🌐 Integrating Linux** to a network in a secure fashion
3. **🔑 Integrating Linux** with Enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM) frameworks
4. **🏰 Implement User ingress controls** to a system/network with bastion frameworks
5. **🔄 Updating Linux** to resolve security vulnerabilities and reporting out to security teams
6. **📤 Design logging workflows** to move event logging off of systems for real time monitoring
7. **👁️ Monitoring and alerting** on events in Linux
8. **🎯 Maintaining system** configuration drift and remediation
{% endhint %}
